## Rules

HexChess follows most of the traditional chess rules with adaptations for the hexagonal board:

- The game is played on a hexagonal board with 91 cells.
- Each player starts with 16 pieces: 1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 1 Dragon (unique to HexChess), and 7 Pawns.
- Piece movements are adapted to the hexagonal grid. For example, Rooks move in straight lines along the six hexagonal directions.
- Pawns move forward in two directions and capture diagonally.
- The Dragon combines the movements of the Queen and Knight.
- Check, checkmate, and stalemate rules apply similar to traditional chess.
- Pawns promote to any other piece (except King) upon reaching the opposite edge of the board.

For a detailed explanation of piece movements and rules, please refer to the in-game help section.
